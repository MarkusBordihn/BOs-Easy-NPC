[![Easy NPC Versions](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/Minecraft_559312_all.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-npc)

Easy NPCs allows a simplified setup for custom NPCs with dialogs for map maker and other mods.

**NOTE: The beta version is still undergoing changes and further testing before its official release. For this reason it will not be compatible with the final release version.**

## âœ¨ Features

- Providing easy NPCs with basic dialogs and a easy setup.
- Easy Action configuration with debug option.
- Skin configuration with player name and URL support.
- Server and client friendly.
- No additional dependencies.
- API support / integration for other mods (WIP).

## Usage

Just spawn a NPC with the corresponding spawn egg and click with your empty hand on the spawned NPC.
If you need to adjust the existing dialog, just click with your empty hand and crouching on the NPC.

## Configuration Items

### Easy NPC Wand

With this tool, players can adjust the settings for EasyNPCs and select the desired NPCs without having to directly target them.

Normally, players have to aim directly at an NPC to select and configure it. With this tool, this process is simplified as it has a larger range and players can simply point at the ground or in the air to select an NPC.

## Dialogs

### Dialog Placeholders

The dialog text supports additional placeholders to allow more personalization for the text.

| Placeholder | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| @npc        | Name of the NPC                     |
| @initiator  | Name of the initiator of the dialog |

### Basic Dialog

The basic dialog allows to display a simple text with max. 255 characters.

### Advanced Dialog

WIP

## Actions

Actions allows you create more interactive parts with your NPC even outside of this mod.
Some basic examples:

- `/say Hello, @initiator ...`
- `/give @initiator stone`
- `/scoreboard players add @initiator close 5`
- `/tp @initiator -28 63 399`

The action are locked with the user permission level.
Which mean that a standard user will not be able to use /give /tp and other related commands for higher permission levels.

By enabling the debug action all executed commands will produce a corresponding feedback in the log like script errors and others.

### Action Placeholders

The action text supports additional placeholders to allow more personalization for the action.

| Placeholder | Description                         |

| @npc        | Name of the NPC                     |

### Remote URL Skins

The remote URL skins allows to use a remote URL for the skin of the NPC.
This option is available for all NPC types.

First you need to get the image URL of the skin image which could require to click on a additional button like "Image Link" or "Direct Link" to get the corresponding URL.

![Remote URL Image Link](/examples/skins/remote_url_image_link.png)

The URL should have a format similar like this: `https://www.example.org/uploads/skins/2019/06/09/kaworru-13064517.png?v538`

Copy and paste this URL it into the corresponding field in the config screen and click on the "Add" button to add the corresponding skin.

After the skin is processed you should see the corresponding skin in the config screen.
Easy NPC use a cache to store the downloaded skins to reduce the load on the remote server.

Depending on the NPC type the available equipments slots are limited.

## Mod integration

### CarryOn

I added a basic block list for the CarryOn mod to exclude the NPC from being picked up.
If this is not working, please use the CarryOn config `carryon-server.toml` to add the NPCs to the block list instead.

```toml
[blacklist]
  ...
  #Entities that cannot be picked up
  forbiddenEntities = [..., "easy_npc:*"]
  ...
```

### Simple Quests

You can use the [Simple Quests](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-quests) mod to create quests for the Easy NPCs.
The quests could be triggered over the action configuration screen of the Easy NPC.
