### Advanced Dialog

WIP

## Actions

Actions allows you create more interactive parts with your NPC even outside of this mod.
Some basic examples:

- `/say Hello, ...`
- `/give @p stone`
- `/scoreboard players add @p close 5`
- `/tp @p -28 63 399`

The action are locked with the user permission level.
Which mean that a standard user will not be able to use /give /tp and other related commands for higher permission levels.

By enabling the debug action all executed commands will produce a corresponding feedback in the log like script errors and others.

### Basic Actions

The basic action screen allows to define actions for the basic dialog screen and the yes/no dialog screen like:

- Player opens dialog screen
- Player close the dialog screen
- Player select "Yes" from the "yes/no" dialog screen
- Player select "No" from the "yes/no" dialog screen
