Easy NPCs allows a simplified setup for custom NPCs with dialogs for mapmaker and other mods.

## ‚ú® Features

- Providing easy NPCs with basic dialogs and a easy setup.
- Easy Action configuration with debug option.
- Skin configuration with player name and URL support.
- Server and client friendly.
- No additional dependencies.
- API support / integration for other mods (WIP).

## üß™ Fabric Beta Version

The current Fabric Beta version presents some limitations and is not yet feature-complete.
These include:

- Absence of a configuration UI
- Non-functionality of the Easy NPC Wand
- Limited support for other mods

Despite these constraints, the Fabric Beta version remains fully functional. Users can create and
configure NPCs with dialogs via the Forge version, and subsequently export them for utilization in
the Fabric version.

## üì¶ Mod Integration

### [Armourer's Workshop][armourers_workshop]

Easy NPC provides a basic integration for [Armourer's Workshop][armourers_workshop] to use the
skins from the library.

### [Epic Fight Mod][epic_fight_mod]

Easy NPC provides a basic integration for [Epic Fight Mod][epic_fight_mod] to use the animations and
models from the mod.
The integration is done over an external mod
called [Easy NPC Epic Fight Mod][easy_npc_epic_fight_mod].

## Usage

Just spawn a NPC with the corresponding spawn egg and click with your empty hand on the spawned NPC.
If you need to adjust the existing dialog, just click with your empty hand and crouching on the NPC.
